This essay is motivated by the remarkable essay of [http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/). The part about finding the research topic, described as spiraling outer loop into inner loop. I am inspired by such metaphor. 

This post is a map I am drawing during exploring the Machine Learnign area. As a 1st year Ph.D student, I am obsessed about specifying my research topic. 



## Pre-voyage check 

I have a background in undergraduate level of mathematics and industrial engineering. I majored statistics in my master. I suggested a statistical method for detecting anomalies in ECG. Currently, I am a Ph.D student of School of Industrial Engineering in Purdue University .


Shortly, I have 

* Strong coding ability 
* Medium statistics and mathematics ability 
* Strong application creativity.

My surrounding environment has advantages in 

* Industrial engineering (Optimization) 
* Healthcare. 

Hence, the most wise decision should be entering to the Machine Learning field with industrial engineering methods, such as optimization and simulation. 

In optimization format, it should be like 

$$ 
\max_{\text{ML_field}}  \text{ matching} (\text{Background, ML_field})  
\text{  s.t } \\ 
\begin{cases}
\text{matching}(\text{ML_field}, \text{IE})  > Z \\
\text{ML_app} \in \text{HE} 
\end{cases}
$$
