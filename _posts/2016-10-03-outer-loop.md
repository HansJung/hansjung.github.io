title: Outer loop of research 
---

This essay is motivated by the remarkable essay of [http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/). The part about finding the research topic, described as spiraling outer loop into inner loop. I am inspired by such metaphor. 

This post is just my memo recording how I am thinking aobut finding reserach. As a 1st year Ph.D student, I am obsessed about specifying my research topic. 

## Outer loop of research 

The very outside of the outer loop, or the surface of the loop, is Machine Learning. Yes, I am eagering to belong to Machine Learning community.
