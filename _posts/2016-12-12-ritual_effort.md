title: Ritual effort 
---

Recently, I have been told about importance of ritual effort multiple times. Firstly, I suddenly made my mind to put my daily activity on a regular cycle filled with ritual efforts. Secondly, Elias in Purdue Computer Science emphasized the importance of ritual effort in training myself as a Ph.D student. My collegue Adib also told me that made a ceaseless step is important. 

A ritual effort is a ceaseless behavior conducted in regular time-interval basis like a ritual praying. One stuying English speaking for a half hour from 12:00pm to 12:30pm everyday can be a good example of ritual effort. As an old quote said that "your habits define who you are", ritual efforts contributes your identity. 

Working on a Ph.D program is a long-tern journey. One should arrive to the creativity zone in his/her research area. To reaching to the creativity area, he/she has to incubate all necessary knowledge to the extent of unconciousness level; one feel comfortable to the knowledge as comfortable as his/her mother language. Nobody can tell how much of incubating phases are needed to reach to the creativity, because creativity comes out of nowhere. It just comes like a God's whisper. Nobody knows when it will come to you, but it only comes to those who are prepared. 

To have creative voice, ritual efforts are essential.
