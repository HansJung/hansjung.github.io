## Problems I am interested 

### 1. Personalized medicine by analyzing disease trajectory for better prediciton based on EHR data. 

Personalized medicine is a medical procedure that separates patients into different groupsâ€”with medical decisions, practices, interventions and/or products being tailored to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine)

More specifically, multiple genes collectively influence the likelihood of developing many common and complex diseases. Personalized medicine can also be used to predict a person's risk for a particular disease. 

With EHR data that is including patients' information and biomarkers (physiological signals), 



## Possible open problem 

1. Classification / Clustering of ECG signal / beat taking account of individuals' information. 
2. Low dimensional projection of multiple longitudinal data corresponding to a specific patient. 
3. Deep learning based anomaly detection scheme in EHR. 
4. Modeling multiple biomarkers in composite GP / GP with kernel learning method. 
5. Poisson matrix factorization in recommendation system. 
6. Readmission rate prediction using Hawkess process 
7. Recurrent GP modeling for ECG. 
 


## Available dataset 

### Breast Cancer Proteomes 

* This data set contains published iTRAQ proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer samples generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH). It contains expression values for ~12.000 proteins for each sample, with missing values present when a given protein could not be quantified in a given sample.

### Zika Virus Epidemic 

* This dataset shares publicly available data related to the ongoing Zika epidemic. It is being provided as a resource to the scientific community engaged in the public health response. The data provided here is not official and should be considered provisional and non-exhaustive. The data in reports may change over time, reflecting delays in reporting or changes in classifications. And while accurate representation of the reported data is the objective in the machine readable files shared here, that accuracy is not guaranteed. Before using any of these data, it is advisable to review the original reports and sources, which are provided whenever possible along with further information on the CDC Zika epidemic GitHub repo.

### Hospital Charges for Inpatients

* Variation of hospital charges in the various hospitals in the US for the top 100 diagnoses. The dataset is owned by the US government. This dataset will show you how price for the same diagnosis and the same treatment and in the same city can vary differently across different providers. It might help you or your loved one find a better hospital for your treatment. You can also analyze to detect fraud among providers.

### Breast cancer dataset 

* Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.
