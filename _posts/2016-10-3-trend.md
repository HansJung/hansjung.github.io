## Start to turn in outer loop in Machine Learning 

Recently, I read one remarkable essay in [karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/](karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/). I am impressed his description of turning outer loop of the research field, picking the specific area, and going into the inner loop. 

His tip about finding a research topic appealed to me, because I am at the moment of finding the specific research topic.
